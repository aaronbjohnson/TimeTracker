# Command Line Time Tracker
This project came from my daily need of a simple time tracker. Most programs were way to complicated for my needs. I wanted something that would allow me to move between projects quickly. At the end of a day I can view a summary of time worked on projects and then transfer that to my accounting software.

## How it works
The typical workflow is that you first create a project by providing a project name. You can then choose to start a timer. Whenever you want to stop the time, just type "end". This time can then be added to the Timesheet for that day or discarded if for whatever reason you decide not to keep track of that interval. 

You can create multiple projects, and even edit the total time for each project in case a mistake was made. You also have the option to merge two projects into one.

The main menu has the option of viewing all the projects started during the session and shows their total time. You can save this output to a log file for reference later.
